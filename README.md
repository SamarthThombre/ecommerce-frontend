⚙️ Tech Stack
React.js

React Router

Context API – for cart state management

Tailwind CSS – for styling

Vite – for fast development and builds

Axios – to handle API requests

🧠 How It Works
Add to Cart: Products are added to cart with a quantity field.

Cart Page: Lists all added items, calculates total price.

Authentication: Login/signup works via backend JWT flow.

UI Logic: Header shows login/signup or avatar based on auth state.

🔧 Setup & Run Locally
